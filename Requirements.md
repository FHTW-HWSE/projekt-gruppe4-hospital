## User stories

1. As a hospital staff member, I want to be able to add patients who arrived at the ER on their own, so that they can be prioritized and assigned a seat if possible.

2. As a hospital staff member, I want to be able to add patients who arrived at the ER through an ambulance, so that they can be prioritized for urgent treatment.

3. As a hospital staff member, I want to be able to remove a patient from the system after they have received successful treatment, so that they are no longer listed and can make room for new patients.

4. As a hospital staff member, I want to be able to query which seat partners a patient has, so that in case of an infectious disease outbreak, the hospital can notify the seat partners of the affected patient.

5. As a hospital staff member, in case where all seats are occupied, I want to assign patients to a standing list / queue so that when a free seat is available they can be assigned to it.
