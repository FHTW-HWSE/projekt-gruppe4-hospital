# Project Title

This project aims to prioritize patients in a hospital emergency room and assign seats to walk-ins. The program treats ambulance arrivals first and assigns seats to people who walk in by themselves for potential contact tracing. The seating area has 25 seats in a 5x5 pattern, and only seat neighbors within a row need tracking.
